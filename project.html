<p style ="color:brown;"/>  Electrodynamics is a branch of physics that deals with the effects arising from the interactions of electric currents with magnets, with other currents, or with themselves. In other words,Electrodynamics, is the study of phenomena associated with charged bodies in motion and varying electric and magnetic fields (see charge ; electricity ); since a moving charge produces a magnetic field , electrodynamics is concerned with effects such as magnetism , electromagnetic radiation , and electromagnetic induction , including such practical applications as the electric generator and the electric motor. This area of electrodynamics, often known as classical electrodynamics, was first systematically explained by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell. Maxwell's equations, a set of differential equations, describe the phenomena of this area with great generality. </p>
